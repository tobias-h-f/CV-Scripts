Assignment 1 - Introduktion til databehandling
"""


"""

Simple Python codes for the coding camp of the first few weeks of the Master of Data Science on SDU

The assignment was rated 14/15 points. The subtracted point was due to the use of while loop
in the last assignment instead of a for loop.
